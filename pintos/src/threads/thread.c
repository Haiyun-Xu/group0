   * switch_threads() and does not have its registers pushed onto its stack, we
   * have to prepare its switch_threads() stack frame here.
   * 
   * Since the entering thread must call thread_schedule_tail() but there's no way
   * for the new thread to return into the middle of schedule() and call thread_schedule_tail()
   * there, we have to create a new function called thread_entry() that calls

   * function. swich_thread adjusts the new thread's stack pointer, and calls
   * thread_schedule_tail().
   *

   * new stub function that calls the given FUNCTION. This stub function is

   * thread_schedule_tail(). kernel_thread() shouldn't return to anything, so
   * if the new thread's starting function returns to it, it should terminate
   * the thread.
   * 
   * Therefore, the new thread's stack frame is organized as follows:
   * - the bottom stack frame (lowest addressed) is for switch_threads(). The
   *   frame is represented by `struct switch_thread_frame` and it's important
   *   to set its `eip` member, the return address of switch_threads(), to the
   *   address of switch_entry();
   * - the second stack frame is for switch_entry. The frame is represented by
   *   `struct switch_entry_frame` and it's important to set its `eip` member,
   *   the return address of switch_entry(), to the address of kernel_thread();
   * - the top stack frame (highest addressed) is for kernel_thread(). The frame
   *   is represented by `struct kernel_thread_frame` and it's important to set
   *   its `function` and `aux` members. Since we don't expect kernel_thread()
   *   to return to anything, its `eip` return address member can be set to NULL - 
   *   but it must be presence due to x86 calling convention;
